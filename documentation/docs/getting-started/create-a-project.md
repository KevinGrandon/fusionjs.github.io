# Create a project

The easiest way to create a project is to clone one of our boilerplate applications here: https://github.com/kevingrandon/fusion-boilerplate

We are working on creating tools which will automatically scaffold a new application in the future.

Alternatively, visit the [project structure](/docs/getting-started/project-structure) page and emulate the project structure, creating an application from scratch.
